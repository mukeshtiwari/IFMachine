1. Client application (client_fed_learn.c) is done, but we need driver code to run client and accept parameter from server
2. Server application which averages all the parameters and sends it back to clients again (driver code is also needed)
3. Training data (I need some training data, preferably medical data)
4. Right now, the client application is a framework in which we plug any learning algorithm, and for the moment it is linear regression
   using gradient descent, but it would be nice if we can use some other algorithms as well. Moreover, we don't have any proof about 
   the learning algorithm so try to find what is happening in machine learning formal verification or what properties can be proved 
   about gradient descent itself. 
5. Finally, plug all the pieces together, run it, and produce some result.
